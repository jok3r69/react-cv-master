                    <span className="dot"></span> Since I was a little kid, I was always seeking ways to make money.
                         I started to buy stuff from the oser and sell them on the internet.
                        By the time, I was older, I managed to find some information about the stock exchange.
                        So, when I was at the faculty, I opened up a trading account on the Bucharest Stock Exchange.
                        This was back in 2017. How the time is passing I am making more and more money because of the compouded
                        interest. 
                        <p>
                        <span className="dot"></span>So this is the same thing in life and knowlade. How you get older, you want to know more and more things and seek
                            for a bit of discomfort, since nothing is growing in our confortzone. So I started to invest more in me and less
                            in the stock exchange, becuase I am seeking to grow myself and not just my wealth, since the more I know the wealthyer I can be!
                            So here I am, at the age of 25, with a Front End web dev course and now I am looking for a more challangeing job.
                            The job I have in this moment, is not challangeing and I feel like I can't grow here. So if you are touched by my story,
                            and you'd like to work with me, hit me up with a mail by completing the form from the contact page and I will get in touch with
                            you as soon as it's possible!
